### S. Alvarez-Andrade, S. Bouzebda and A. Lachal
The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the strong approximation
of the $$p$$-fold integrated empirical process, p being a fixed positive integer. More
precisely, we obtain the exact rate of the approximations by a sequence of weighted
Brownian bridges and a weighted Kiefer process. Our arguments are based in part
on the Komlós et al. (Z Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verw Gebiete 32:111–131,
1975)’s results. Applications include the two-sample testing procedures together with
the change-point problems. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the
finite sample performance of the proposed statistical tests based on the integrated
empirical processes.
