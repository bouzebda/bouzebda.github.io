### S. Bouzebda and S. Slaoui
In the present paper, we study general kernel type estimatorsfor censored data defined by the stochastic approximation algorithm. We establish a central limit theorem for the proposed estimators. 
We characterize the strong pointwise convergence rate for the nonparametric recursive general kernel-type estimators under some mild conditions.
