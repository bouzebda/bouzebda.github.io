### S. Alvarez-Andrade and S. Bouzebda
The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the strong approximation
of the weighed bootstrap of empirical and quantile
processes. The bootstrap idea is to reweight the original empirical
distribution by stochastic weights. Our results are applied in two
concrete statistical problems: the Q–Q processes as well as the
kernel-type density estimator. Finally, a general notion of bootstrapped
empirical quantile processes, from randomly censored
data, constructed by exchangeably weighting samples is presented.
