### S. Bouzebda and  T. Zari
We study the behavior of bivariate empirical copula process $$\mathbb{G}_n(\cdot,\cdot)$$ on pavements $$[0,k_n/n]^2$$ of $$[0,1]^2,$$ where $$k_n$$ is a sequence of positive constants fulfilling some conditions. 
We provide a upper bound for the strong approximation of $$\mathbb{G}_n(\cdot,\cdot)$$  by a Gaussian process when $$k_n/n \searrow \gamma$$ as $$n\rightarrow \infty,$$ where $$0 \leq \gamma \leq 1.$$
