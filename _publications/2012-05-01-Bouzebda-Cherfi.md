### S. Bouzebda and M. Cherfi
The main purpose of the present paper is to propose a new estimator of the tail index using $$\phi$$-divergences and the duality technique. These estimators are explored with respect to robustness through the influence function approach. 
The empirical performances of the proposed estimators are illustrated by simulation
