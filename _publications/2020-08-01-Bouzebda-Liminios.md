### S. Bouzebda and N. Limnios 

In the present work, we are mainly concerned with the uniform central limit theorem for a bootstrapped martingale-difference array of a function-indexed stochastic process under the uniformly integrable entropy condition. 
More precisely, we establish the consistency of the exchangeable bootstraps.
