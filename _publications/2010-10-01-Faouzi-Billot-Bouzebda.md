This study reports the main findings of the Travel time Prediction based on electronic Toll collection
(ETC) data with wEather effect integration on mOtorways (TPTEO) project aiming at developing and
implementing a route planner tool and travel time prediction system on the interurban motorway network
managed by French motorway AREA Company. One of the main innovative characteristics of this project is
the use of toll collection data (TCD) to derive speed and travel time estimation and prediction. This data
source is becoming more and more available on motorway facilities and provides an efficient way not only to
estimate and predict travel time but also to achieve the origin–destination (OD) matrices elaboration and
exhibit trends in traffic. Based on the previous studies on weather effect quantification, the prediction
algorithm is designed to account for the weather impact during the prediction process. The resulting tool is
considered to be accurate enough and paves the way for developing weather responsive advanced traffic
management and information systems.
