### S. Bouzebda and A. Keziou
In the present paper, a semiparametric maximum-likelihood-type
test statistic is proposed and proved to have the same limit null
distribution as the classical parametric likelihood one. Under some
mild conditions, the limiting law of the proposed test statistic, suitably
normalized and centralized, is shown to be double exponential,
under the null hypothesis of no change in the parameter of
copula models. We also discuss the Gaussian-type approximations
for the semiparametric likelihood ratio. The asymptotic distribution
of the proposed statistic under specified alternatives is shown
to be normal, and an approximation to the power function is given.
Simulation results are provided to illustrate the finite sample performance
of the proposed statistical tests based on the double exponential
and Gaussian-type approximations.
