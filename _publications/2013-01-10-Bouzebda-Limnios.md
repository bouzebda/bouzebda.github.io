### S. Bouzebda and N. Limnios

A general notion of bootstrapped empirical estimators, of the semi-Markov kernels and
of the conditional transition probabilities for semi-Markov processes with countable state
space, constructed by exchangeably weighting sample, is introduced. Asymptotic properties
of these generalized bootstrapped empirical distributions are obtained by means of the
martingale approach.
