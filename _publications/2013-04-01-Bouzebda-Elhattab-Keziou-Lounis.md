### S. Bouzebda, I. Elhattab, A. Keziou and T. Lounis

In the present article, we propose a new estimator of entropy based on smooth estimators
of quantile density. The consistency and asymptotic distribution of the proposed
estimates are obtained. As a consequence, a new test of normality is proposed. A small
power comparison is provided. A simulation study for the comparison, in terms of mean
squared error, of all estimators under study is performed.
