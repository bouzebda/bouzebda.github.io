### S. Bouzebda, M. Chaouch and N. Laïb
The main purpose of the present work  is to establish the functional
asymptotic normality   of a class of kernel conditional mode
estimates whenever functional stationary ergodic data are
considered. More precisely,   consider a random variable $$(X, Z)$$
taking values in some semi-metric abstract space $$E\times F$$. For
a real function $$\varphi$$ defined on $$F$$ and for each $$x\in E$$, we
consider the conditional mode, say $$\Theta_\varphi(x)$$, of the
real random variable $$\varphi(Z)$$ given the event $$``X=x"$$. While
estimating the conditional mode function by
$$\widehat{\Theta}_{\varphi, n}(x)$$,  using the kernel-type estimator,
we establish the limiting law of the family of processes
$$\{\widehat{\Theta}_\varphi(x)-\Theta_\varphi(x)\}$$ (suitably
normaliezd)  over Vapnik-Chervonenkis class $${\cal C}$$ of
functions $$\varphi$$. Beyond ergodicity, any other assumption is
imposed on the data. This paper extends the scope of  some previous results
established under mixing condition for a fixed function $$\varphi$$. From this
result, the asymptotic normality of a class of predictors is
derived and confidence bands are constructed. Finally, a general
notion of bootstrapped  conditional mode constructed by
exchangeably
 weighting samples is presented. The usefulness of this result will be illustrated in the construction of confidence bands.
