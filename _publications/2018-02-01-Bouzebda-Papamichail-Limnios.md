### S. Bouzebda, C. Papamichail and N. Limnios
The present paper introduces a general notion and presents results
of bootstrapped empirical estimators of the semi-Markov kernels and
of the conditional transition distributions for semi-Markov processes
with countable state space, constructed by exchangeably weighting
the sample. Our proposal provides a unification of bootstrap
methods in the semi-Markov setting including, in particular, Efron’s
bootstrap. Asymptotic properties of these generalised bootstrapped
empirical distributions are obtained, under mild conditions by a martingale
approach. We also obtain some new results on the weak convergence
of the empirical semi-Markov processes. We apply these
general results in several statistical problems such as the construction
of confidence bands and the goodness-of-fit tests where the
limiting distributions are derived under the null hypothesis. Finally,
we introduce the quantile estimators and their bootstrapped versions
in the semi-Markov framework and we establish their limiting
laws by using the functional delta methods. Our theoretical results
and numerical examples by simulations demonstrate the merits of
the proposed techniques.
