### S. Alvarez-Andrade and S. Bouzebda
In the present work, we consider the asymptotic distributions of $L_p$ functionals of
bootstrapped weighted uniform quantile and empirical processes. The asymptotic
laws obtained are represented in terms of Gaussian integrals. We investigate the
strong approximations for the bootstrapped Vervaat process and the weighted bootstrap
for Bahadur-Kiefer process. We obtain new results on the precise asymptotics
in the law of the logarithm related to complete convergence and a.s. convergence,
under some mild conditions, for the weighted bootstrap of empirical and the quantile
processes. In addition we consider the strong approximation of the hybrids of
empirical and partial sums processes when the sample size is random.
