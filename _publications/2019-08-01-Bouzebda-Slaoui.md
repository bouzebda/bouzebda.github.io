### S. Bouzebda and Y. Slaoui
In the present paper, we are mainly concerned with a family of kernel type estimators
based upon spatial data. More precisely, we establish large and moderate deviations
principles for the recursive kernel estimators of a regression function for spatial data
defined by the stochastic approximation algorithm.
