### S. Bouzebda and A. Keziou
We introduce new estimates and tests of independence in copula models with unknown margins using $$\varphi$$-divergences and the duality technique. 
The asymptotic laws of the estimates and the test statistics are established both when the parameter is an interior point or not.
