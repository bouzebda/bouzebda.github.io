### S. Alvarez-Andrade and S. Bouzebda

In the present paper, we are mainly interested in Cramér-type results for the
weighted bootstrap of the $$U$$-statistics. The method of proof is based on the Hoeffding
decomposition according to the bootstrapped Cramér transform together with the
contraction technique. Finally, we investigate theU-statistics indexed by a one dimensional
symmetric random walk.
