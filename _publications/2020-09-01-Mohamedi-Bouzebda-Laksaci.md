The aim of this paper is to nonparametrically estimate the expectile regression in the case of a functional predictor and a scalar
response. More precisely, we construct a kernel-type estimator of the expectile regression function. The main contribution of
this study is the establishment of the asymptotic properties of the expectile regression estimator. Precisely, we establish the
almost complete convergence with rate. Furthermore, we obtain the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under some
mild conditions. We provide how to apply our results to construct the confidence intervals. The case of functional predictor is
of particular interest and challenge, both from theoretical as well as practical point of view. We discuss the potential impacts
of functional expectile regression in NFDA with a particular focus on the supervised classification, prediction and financial risk
analysis problems. Finally, the finite-sample performances of the model and the estimation method are illustrated using the analysis
of simulated data and real data coming from the financial risk analysis.
