### S. Bouzebda and N. Limnios
The aim of this paper is to introduce a general bootstrap by exchangeable weight random
variables for empirical estimators of the semi-Markov kernels and of the conditional
transition probabilities for semi-Markov processes with countable state space. Asymptotic
properties of these generalized bootstrapped empirical distributions are obtained by a
martingale approach. We show how to apply our results to the construction of confidence
intervals and change point problem where the limiting distribution of the proposed statistic
is derived under the null hypothesis.
