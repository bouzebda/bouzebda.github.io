### S. Bouzebda and M. Cherfi.
We introduce some new nonparametric statistical tests of symmetry. The limiting behaviors of the proposed statistics are established under the null hypothesis. Emphasis is placed on explanation of the strong approximation methodology. The asymptotic validity of a re-sampling method to compute p-values is also established. A simulation study for some considered statistics is performed.
