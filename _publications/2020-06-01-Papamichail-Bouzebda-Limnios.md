### C. Papamichail, S. Bouzebda and N. Limnios

In the present paper, we are mainly concerned with the degradation mechanism that
arises in fatigue crack growth (FCG). The crack evolution mechanism is modeled by
a first order stochastic differential system, composed by a deterministic FCG equation
perturbed by a stochastic process. The main purpose is to investigate the estimators
of the model parameters and establish some asymptotic properties by transforming
the initial equation into a regression model. To this purpose, least squares
estimation (LSE) is applied in the framework of the errors being martingale differences.
The parametric conditional LSE are proved to be consistent. Our results are
obtained in the general case and specified for the linear case with focus on a particular
application model derived from the most widely used FCG law in fracture
mechanics, i.e., the Paris model. We derive the asymptotic normality of the LSE for
the nonlinear case with discussion for the linear case. Finally, we provide a numerical
example to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology, on a particular
version of the stochastic model.
