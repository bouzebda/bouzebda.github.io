### S. Bouzebda and A. Keziou
We introduce new estimates and tests of independence in copula models with unknown margins using $$\Phi$$-divergences and the duality technique. 
The asymptotic laws of the estimates and the test statistics are established both when the parameter is an interior or a boundary value of the parameter space. 
Simulation results show that the choice of $$\chi_2$$-divergence has good properties in terms of efficiency-robustness. [<img src=" /images/PDF.png" width="25" height="25">Download paper here](https://www.kybernetika.cz/content/2010/1/178)
