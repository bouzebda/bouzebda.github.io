### S. Bouzebda
We introduce some new nonparametic tests of independence which are functionals of
the modified multivariate empirical copula process. In this work we extend the modified empirical
process of Nikitin and Sporysheva (2009), which is defined by using a family of Gaussian processes
of Deheuvels (2007b) to the multivariate case. The limiting behavior of the proposed statistics is established
under the null hypothesis. Emphasis is placed on explanation of the strong approximation
methodology.
